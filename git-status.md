# Definition: git status

The `git status` command is used to display the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git.

In JupyterLab IDE, you can access similar information through the Git extension. The Git panel in JupyterLab shows the status of your files, indicating which files are staged, unstaged, and untracked, similar to the output of the `git status` command.
